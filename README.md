# Haper

## About

This app utilizes TMDB Api to list few categories of movies from which user can select and proceed to book tickets for [Not really ðŸ˜…].
Kind of a BookMyShow Clone.

### What is that name?
Just googled online bussiness name generator and entered bunch of keywords in the first link that appeared and out of the few suggestions "Haper" was one.

### What about the Logo?
Same ðŸ˜ƒ! , online logo generator with some keywords like ticket booking etc... I think it looks nice.

## Why did you build this?

Well , I have never really built something using pure JS , HTML and CSS Especially an SPA. So , wanted to try something and I came across TMDB sometime ago, So , wanted to build something with it.

## Tech Stack

* VanillaJS.
* Html/Css.
* TMDB Api
* Firebase [Firestore & Auth].
* Nprogress [A simple lightweight progressbar].
* Parcel Bundler.
* Deployed on Netlify.

> ps: The package.json can serve as a boilerplate for any vanillaJS project, Feel free to use it if you like it.

## What's cool about this?

Hmm , I guess few things were interesting while building this app.
First of all , I have never really visualized and got my hands on in making an SPA with plain JS. So, basically wanted to create modular JS files which render HTML based on user actions onto the single HTML page which is index.html and all these JS files are bundled using a bundler [Chose Parcel - will try webpack sometime soon].

Then there are implementations like
* Carousel , 
* SearchBar with Debouncing ,
* Routing , 
* AuthGuard using cookies ,
* Reddit like deep nested comments.
* And creating a project from scratch. like setting up package.json , linters , bundler etc..
